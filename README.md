#Art Gallery Project
# WEBD-EXAM

In this project, I have created an art gallery website of my own.
The features that I have added in it are:
Images of artworks.
Their name and descriptions.
Their discounted and original prices
A link to their external website.
A section on how to make your own art gallery
A section on what materials and techniques are needed to make an art gallery
A table comparing the different artworks in my art gallery.

To achieve this, I have used my html knowledge.
The tags that I have used in my project are as follows:
img tag, anchor tag, strong tag, em tag, br tag, table tag, tr tag, th tag, td tag, hr tag, del tag, ol tag, ul tag, li tag, h1, h2 tags and p tags
